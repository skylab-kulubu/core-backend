# Media lifecycle and blob retention

`DELETE /v1/media/{id}` archives media metadata. It is idempotent, hides the
record from ordinary media reads immediately, and does not delete the R2 object.
Authorized management reads can use `GET /v1/media?lifecycle=inactive` or
`lifecycle=all`. `POST /v1/media/{id}/restore` restores the record while its
blob is still recoverable.

The background purge worker runs one bounded batch at startup and on its
configured interval. A record is eligible only after the recovery window. The
worker refuses to purge media still referenced by an Event cover or gallery,
a User profile, a Certificate template draft, or a published Certificate
template version. Database triggers also reject new durable references to
inactive or purged media.

Blob deletion is a crash-safe two-phase transition:

1. `blob_purge_started_at` is committed after the locked reference check.
2. Restore is rejected with a conflict while this durable claim exists.
3. R2 deletion is retried idempotently; a process failure after object deletion
   leaves the claim intact.
4. `blob_purged_at` is committed only after object deletion succeeds.

After `blob_purged_at` is set, the metadata remains available to authorized
lifecycle views for audit, but restore returns `410 Gone`. There is no public
force-purge endpoint.

Configuration:

- `MEDIA_BLOB_RECOVERY_DAYS` — recovery window in whole days; default `30`.
- `MEDIA_BLOB_PURGE_INTERVAL` — Go duration between bounded runs; default `1h`.
- `MEDIA_BLOB_PURGE_BATCH_SIZE` — maximum records per run; default `25`.
