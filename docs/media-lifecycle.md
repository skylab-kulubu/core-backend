# Media lifecycle and blob retention

`DELETE /v1/media/{id}` archives media metadata. It is idempotent, hides the
record from ordinary media reads immediately, and does not delete the R2 object.
Authorized management reads can use `GET /v1/media?lifecycle=inactive` or
`lifecycle=all`. `POST /v1/media/{id}/restore` restores the record while its
blob is still recoverable.

The background purge worker runs one bounded batch at startup and on its
configured interval. A record is eligible only after the recovery window. The
worker refuses to purge media still referenced by an Event cover or gallery,
a User profile, a Certificate template draft, or a published Certificate
template version. Database triggers also reject new durable references to
inactive or purged media.

Blob deletion is a crash-safe two-phase transition:

1. `blob_purge_started_at` is committed after the locked reference check.
2. Restore is rejected with a conflict while this durable claim exists.
3. R2 deletion is retried idempotently; a process failure after object deletion
   leaves the claim intact.
4. `blob_purged_at` is committed only after object deletion succeeds.

After `blob_purged_at` is set, the metadata remains available to authorized
lifecycle views for audit, but restore returns `410 Gone`. There is no public
force-purge endpoint.

New uploads use a separate subject-bound durable staging intent. Its insert and
metadata publication both acquire the same subject lock and active/deletion-
marker guard as every other current-identity link. Core inserts the object key
and uploader subject in PostgreSQL before writing R2, then inserts media
metadata and removes that intent in one row-locked transaction. If the request
crashes, the object write is rejected, or immediate compensation cannot reach
R2, the intent survives and a bounded sweeper retries idempotent deletion. The
sweeper takes the same row lock as metadata publication and rechecks
`media.file_url`, so it cannot delete a published object. An ambiguous metadata
commit is reconciled by media ID and never triggers eager deletion while the
publication outcome is unknown. Account erasure also waits for active intents
and checkpoints subject-specific blob cleanup before deleting the identity or
completing its request.

Configuration:

- `MEDIA_BLOB_RECOVERY_DAYS` — recovery window in whole days; default `30`.
- `MEDIA_BLOB_PURGE_INTERVAL` — Go duration between bounded runs; default `1h`.
- `MEDIA_BLOB_PURGE_BATCH_SIZE` — maximum records per run; default `25`.
- `MEDIA_UPLOAD_STAGING_GRACE` — delay before abandoned uploads are eligible;
  minimum `2m`, default `24h`.
- `MEDIA_UPLOAD_STAGING_SWEEP_INTERVAL` — retry sweep interval; default `15m`.
- `MEDIA_UPLOAD_STAGING_BATCH_SIZE` — maximum staging intents per run; default
  `25`.
